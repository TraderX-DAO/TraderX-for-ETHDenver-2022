## Project Description

TraderX helps crypto investors WIN regardless of market conditions! Investors can build and run their own on-chain or off-chain SMART TRADING BOTs based on investment strategies used by investment banks and hedge funds; and with data feed generated by our own AI/Data analytics engine. Be it market neutral, long-only, thematic, dispersion, or data-driven, you can always find something on TraderX to help you WIN!

### Trader Dashboards

Through their dashboards, investors can get a snapshot of the TraderX bot they have set up and running, and their performances.


### Strategy

A repository for all pre-built and automated TraderX investment strategies, where detailed explanation and analysis for each strategy can be found.


### Bot Setup

Center of the dApp, where investors can build their own smart TraderX BOTs following the steps below:

![Bot Setup Screen 1](/img/Mockup_Screen_1.png "Bot Setup Screen 1")
![Bot Setup Screen 2](/img/Mockup_Screen_2.png "Bot Setup Screen 2")

#### Step 1: 

Select one investment strategies from the pre-built list, based on current market condition and personal preferences.

#### Step 2:

Select from TraderX suggested asset, asset pairs or asset baskets which are suitable for investor's strategy selection from previous step, based on the data feed from TraderX's proprietary AI/Data Analytics engine.

#### Step 3:

Select 1 out of the 3 automatic Bot stop conditions:

Condition 1) Time based: 
* Bot stops automatically when block time reaches pre-defined time period (1d/1wk/1mth).

Condition 2) Profit target based: 
* Bot stops automatically when trading profit reaches profit target (5%, 10%, 20% etc).

Condition 3) Stop loss threshold based: 
* Bot stops automatically when trade mark-to-market positions exceeds predefined stop loss threshold. For example, the threshold could be set at 5% above lending pool liquidation threshold, to avoid lending pool positions getting liquidated if price went against prediction.


#### Step 4:

Select from an universe of available exchanges (DEXs, CEXs, AMM liquidity pools, lending pools...) to trade the bot on. TraderX default selection will be available to investors as well.


## How to Run this DApp

### Pre-requisites


#### 1. Node.js

Check whether you have Node.js in your machine with the following command, otherwise click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install it.

```bash
node -v
```

#### 2. NPM

If you have installed Node.js in your machine, NPM will already be installed along with it. Check whether NPM is installed within your machine with the following command.

```bash
npm -v
```

#### 3. Hardhat

Check whether you have `hardhat` in your machine with the following command.

```bash
npx hardhat --version
```

If not installed, just follow the hardhat command prompt to install `hardhat` into your local project environment based on your need.

#### 4. Solidity (solc-js)

If you installed hardhat, it should come with `solc` by default. As an additional tool, install `Solidity` and `Solidity Extended` VSCode Plugin by `Juan Blanco` and `beaugunderson`, respectively.

#### 5. Metamask

If you have not installed Metamask in your browser, click [here](https://metamask.io/download.html) and follow the instruction to complete the installation process.

### Getting Started
 
#### 1. Add Environment Variables

Make a new file called `.env` and fill in the following variables

```
PRIVATE_KEY=xxx
ALCHEMY_API_URL=xxx
```

#### 2. Compile the project

```bash
npx hardhat compile --network kovan
```

#### 3. Test the project

```bash
npx hardhat test --network kovan
```
